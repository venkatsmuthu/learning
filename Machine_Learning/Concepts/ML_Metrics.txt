Metrics in Machine Learning
===========================
Classification Evaluation metrics
-----------------------
Accuracy
Logarithmic loss
	0 to 1
	0 - better model
	1 - worse model
Area under Curve
	TPR = TP/(TP+FN)
	FPR = FP/(FP+TN)
	Plot TPR(y) and FPR(x)
	0 to 1
	1 - better model
	0.5 - random classifier
	>0.5 - worse than random
Precision
	TP/(TP+FP)
Recall
	TP/(TP+FN)
F1 score
	Hormonic mean of prcision and recall
	F1 = 2 * (precision * recall) /(precision + recall)
	A higher F1 score means the model performs well in both correctly identifying positives and avoiding false positives.
	Use F1 Score when you need a balance between Precision and Recall.
	Use Precision when false positives are more costly (e.g., detecting fraud).
	Use Recall when false negatives are more costly (e.g., medical diagnoses).
